title:  Common Tools
---

In this section, we will cover the tools that are commonly used in the software development industry.

## Version Control

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.

### Git

Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used in the software development industry. It is a free and open-source tool that is easy to learn and has a small footprint.

Git is by far the leader today in version control systems. It is used by millions of developers around the world and is the most popular version control system today.

There are alternatives and competitors to Git, such as Mercurial, Subversion, and Perforce, but Git is the most popular and widely used.

Most common Git commands:
    
    ```bash
    git init
    git add
    git commit
    git status
    git log
    git branch
    git checkout
    git merge
    git pull
    git push
    git rebase
    ```
