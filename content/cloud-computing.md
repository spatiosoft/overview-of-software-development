title: Cloud Computing
---

Cloud computing allows deploying, managing,
and scaling applications without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. 
It is a model for enabling on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources
(e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services).
These resources can be rapidly provisioned and released.

Instead of managing physical servers in your own datacenters, you can rent the resources you need from a cloud provider.

The major cloud providers are:
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com)
- [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud)
- [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud)
- [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com)
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com)

## Main components

The major cloud providers offer a wide range of services for very specific needs.
However, there are some common components that you will find in all cloud providers.

### Container

A container packages the code and its dependencies together.
It allows executing the code in a consistent environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

### Network

The network is the backbone of cloud computing. 
It allows connecting the different components of the cloud infrastructure.

With a load balancer, you can distribute the incoming traffic across multiple servers.

### Storage

Storage offers spaces to store data. 
Usually, you can store as many data as you want as the system will scale automatically.

The storage is accessible from anywhere in the world and from all your components and microservices.
This allows sharing data between different components.

### Database

### Access Management

### Monitoring

### Logging

### Security

### Zones and Regions

## Infrastructure as Code
