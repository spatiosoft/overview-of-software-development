## Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic architecture is an application built as one single structure containing all the components.
It was very popular in the past and has become less popular with the rise of microservices architecture.
The advantages:
- Easier to develop
- Easier to test
- Easier to deploy

The disadvantages:
- Hard to scale
- Hard to maintain
- Risk of conflicts between teams

## Microservice Architecture

A microservice architecture is an application built as a collection of small services.
Each service is responsible for a specific task. 
They communicate with each other through APIs.

The advantages:
- Easier to scale
- Easier to maintain
- Teams can work independently

The disadvantages:
- Hard to develop
- Hard to test
- Hard to deploy
