title: Frameworks
---

Frameworks are a set of tools and libraries that help you build web applications faster. They provide a structure for you to build on, and often come with a lot of built-in functionality that you would otherwise have to build yourself.

Frameworks can be very opinionated, meaning they have a specific way of doing things that you have to follow. This can be a good thing because it can help you build applications faster, but it can also be a bad thing because it can limit your flexibility.

There are many different frameworks out there, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
