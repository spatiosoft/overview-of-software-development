# DevOps and DevSecOps

DevOps stands for Development and Operations.
It is a way to organize and combine the teams responsible for developing and operating software.
Instead of having one team developing the software and another team operating it, DevOps combines both teams into one.
The one team become responsible for every aspect of the software, from development to operation.

Often, DevOps is seen as a job title, but it's rather a way of organizing the work and the teams in a company.

The purpose of DevOps is 
to shorten the software development lifecycle by providing continuous integration and continuous delivery of software.
