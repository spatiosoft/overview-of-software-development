title: Container And Container Management
---

In this section, we will discuss containers and container management.

In the software development industry, containers are used to package and run applications. Containers are lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.

They can be seen an operating system, usually Linux, that runs inside another operating system, the host system.

A host system can run multiple containers, each with its own isolated environment. Containers are portable and can run on any system that supports the container runtime.

## Concept

### Container

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

### Image

In the container world, an image is a file that contains a snapshot of a container.
The analogy would be if you would take all the files on your computer and put them into a zip file. The zip file would be the image, and the files inside the zip file would be the container.

The magic of an image is that you can use an image to create a container. You can think of an image as a template for a container.

From an image you can also create a new image by adding new files, changing existing, or deleting them.
