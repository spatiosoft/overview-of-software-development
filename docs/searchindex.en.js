Containers are lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.\nThey can be seen an operating system, usually Linux, that runs inside another operating system, the host system.\nA host system can run multiple containers, each with its own isolated environment. Containers are portable and can run on any system that supports the container runtime.\nConcept Container A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.\nImage In the container world, an image is a file that contains a snapshot of a container. The analogy would be if you would take all the files on your computer and put them into a zip file. The zip file would be the image, and the files inside the zip file would be the container.\nThe magic of an image is that you can use an image to create a container. You can think of an image as a template for a container.\nFrom an image you can also create a new image by adding new files, changing existing, or deleting them.\nVolume Network Container Management Docker Docker [official website]\nDocker Swarm Docker Swarm\nKubernetes Kubernetes [official website]\nOpenShift OpenShift [official website]",

Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.\nDeliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.\nBusiness people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.\nBuild projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.\nThe most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress.\nAgile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.\nSimplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.\nThe best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\nAt regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\nAgile Manifesto\nSince then, most of the methodologies that are used today are based on the Agile Manifesto.\nAtlassian Agile Manifesto\nScrum Scrum is a framework that implements the Agile Manifesto. It is the most popular Agile methodology today. The concept is to deliver value continually through cycles called sprints. Those sprints are usually two weeks long but may vary depending on the project.\nScrum describes three roles:\nThe Product Owner, who is the bridge between the stakeholders and the development team.
